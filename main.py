This app allows users to upload a CSV file containing x and y data points from univariate/multivariate time series data.
The app will then interpolate these points using a method of the user's choice.
The goal is extrapolating to predict future values.
"""

# Function to load data from a CSV file.
# Apart from loading data, this function checks if the file has two columns and if the second column contains numeric data.
# IMPORTANT: The labels (e.g. in Earth population, year) are named as 'x', while the second column (data points, e.g. in Earth population, the population itself) is named 'y'. 
# When using this app, ensure that your uploaded file has the first column as the 'x' and the second column as the 'y'.

Creator's Note:
The motivation behind this app is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for users to perform interpolation and extrapolation on their **univariate time series data** ‚Äî that is, datasets where a single variable evolves over time.

    I identified a need for a tool that allows users to easily visualize and predict future values based on historical data, without requiring deep mathematical or programming knowledge.

    This app is particularly useful in fields such as **social sciences**, where data availability is often limited, and yet the need for forecasting and trend analysis is crucial.

    - Supports both **CSV and Excel** formats, making it accessible to a wide range of users.  
    - Designed to be **intuitive** and focused on usability.  
    - Enables **prediction** even when data is sparse or spaced out (e.g., population measured every 5 years).

    In disciplines like **demography, economics, and sociology**, extrapolation and interpolation are often used to estimate future values (e.g., population growth, economic indicators) from past trends.  

    This app aims to make those techniques **more approachable**, especially for students, researchers, and policy analysts.

    Whether you're estimating future populations, projecting economic metrics, or simply exploring trends, this tool helps you do so with ease.
